PlayWright

Notes -------------------------------

1. Running npm run tests, will execute all your tests on chromium, firefox and webkit UNLESS you comment them out
2. NOTE !! All tests run in PARALLEL. 
  If you increase the number of files in example2.spec.js, then we execute those tests in PARALLEL
3. All test files should end in  ".spec.js"
4. To test in mobile, you will need to uncomment the "Mobile Chrome" viewport in playwright.config.js
5. Use Docker to run your code in GitHub Actions



Tips & Tricks -------------------------------

1. You can pause (like a debugger) using page.pause(). 
Then a playwright inspector will appear and you can click the play button to move next
2. Use .waitFor() to wait for a specific elemenet to appear and also get better logs
  - Note: This is affected by playwright config timeout: 5 * 1000,
3. The 'reporter: line' sets the bugs to appear on the console instead of the browser
4. 'test' allow us to write tests
   'expect' allow us to validate something
    import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'
5. Press ctrl+f to open the selector 
6. Set the baseURL in the playwright.config.js file to set the base URL so we dont need to repeat constatly
  - Note: when go to main home page, we just need to do page.goto('/')
7. You can run specific test by using the .only 
  - Ex: test.only()
8. BP: Make sure you define your locators in the constructor in PageObjects
9. BP: Make sure to call waitFor() before performing any action or validation
10. npn install --save PACKAGENAME - Will download from npm and save it into your package.json devDependencies
11. BP: Page Objects should not contain any hard coded values. Should be placed in an object instead 
12. Use JSON.stringify() to convert JSON object to stringify. Why ? So we can send them in the body of a API request
13. Holy Shit ! You can use the console to send cookies to a website ...WHAT ????
14. Use page.evaluate() to execute JS on the browser
15. Use the .env (environment variable) to store username/password credentials
  > You need to install dotenv to read the .env file (npm install --save dotenv)
16. Use globalSetup to instantiate your testcases before they run (ex: execute the dotenv you can access the parameters through the project)
>   globalSetup: require.resolve('./globalSetup.js'),


Questions -------------------------------

##### TODO #####
1. Visit the PlayWright Documentation
2. Understand node_modules
3. Understand the playwright.config.js
4. Find different tricks to locate element
5. Learn what this does ...page.evaluate()

##### Basic Concepts #####

Q1. How to run on Npm ?
1. Execute the "shopping-store-mac-amd64"
2. Go localhost:2221 to make sure it is running
3. Execute the following
  npm run test
  Or
  npm test

Q2. What does the --headed do in package.json ?
1. Opens Browser (i.e this is headed browser execution)
1a.Without the head will run in a headless browser
2. Runs all the tests in "tests" folder

Q3. Why the "tests" folder ?
- Its because we defined that in the package.json
Ex: In Package json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "playwright test --headed"
  },

Q4. What is the purpose of the playwright.config.js ?
1. Executes our tests on each one of the "projects" type i.e Chromium, Firefox, webkit
2. Sets our configuration for the suite


Q5. How to skip tests
- - You can skip by using test.skip()
Running 2 tests using 2 workers
  1 skipped
  1 passed (5.4s)

Q6. What does this mean ? 
import { test } from '@playwright/test' ? 
- This line basically means that we import test from '@playwright/tests' from the package.json ...which then is stored in the node_modules

**TODO: Understand what the Node_modules is ? What, Why, Where, How ?

Q7. How to initiate a tests ? 
1. We need the test object from @playwright/tests
test('TITLE HERE', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('www.XYZ.com')
})

Q8. What is the { tests } object ? 
- It is the test.d.ts file in node_modules

Q9. What is Node Fetch
- Bring Fetch API to Node.js
- Note: version of node-fetch is v2 ... NOT v3
"npm install --save node-fetch@2.6.7"

Q10. How to use dotenv ?
- npm install dotenv
- Create page object
- Create .env file and store username password
- Reference the file 
- import dotenv and run the dotenv.config() to fetch data

Q11. How to add to GitHub Actions ?
1. Create .github folder
2. Create another directory 'workflows'
3. Create playwright.yml file
4. Push to repo
5. Go to Actions in GitHub and see the success message

Q12. What is the difference between npm install vs npm ci ?
- npm install - installs from package.json
- npm ci - installs from package-lock.json

Q13. Why would we want to use the package-lock file ?\
- Make sure our tests our consistent

Q14. Where do you get this line  ? 
      image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.39.0-jammy
- This is coming in from the docker.hub.com for playwright 
In docker we see this: 
"mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.39.0-jammy"
